# WeatherApp — Educational React Project

**WeatherApp** is a single-page application that allows users to view current weather conditions in different cities and save them to a favorites list. The project was built as part of a React learning module and showcases modern frontend development practices.

## Features

- Search for a city and view current weather data
- Add or remove cities from a favorites list
- Toggle between light and dark themes
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop
- Fetch weather data from an external API

## Technologies Used

- **React 19** — component-based UI
- **Vite** — fast development server and bundler
- **React Router** — client-side routing
- **React Icons** — icon library
- **Context API** — global state management (e.g., theme)
- **Recharts** — for data visualization (if applicable)
- **ESLint** — linting and code quality tools
- **Custom Hooks** — encapsulated logic for reusability

## What I Practiced

- Working with public REST APIs
- Managing global and local state
- Creating reusable components and hooks
- Applying responsive design principles
- Using React lifecycle methods (`useEffect`, `useState`, `useContext`)
- Configuring and using ESLint with React projects
